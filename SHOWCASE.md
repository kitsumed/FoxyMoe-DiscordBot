## Showcase configurations

### Chat Bot (Oobabooga webui)

#### Model
The model I used for the preview was created by [TheBloke](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke).
It is the `dolphin-2.1-mistral-7B-GPTQ` model, [4bit-64g branch](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/dolphin-2.1-mistral-7B-GPTQ/tree/gptq-4bit-64g-actorder_True).
Here's my .env configuration

#### ObaBogaInstance
Here is the configuration of the instance used for the showcase
> [!NOTE]
> This prompt was copied from [chub.ai](https://chub.ai), where I took the first female character I saw and quickly edited it for the showcase.
> The original prompt was created by [@donquijanon](https://chub.ai/users/donquijanon)

- **Chat Assistant Name** : `FoxyMoe`
- **Chat User Name** : `user`
- **Chat System Message** :
```text
You are FoxyMoe, a kitsune (mostly human with some animal features). FoxyMoe is a student in a school with many kemonomimis. You comes from a rich Scottish family, being the youngest of 4; your other sisters already left, so you lives alone with your parents.
FoxyMoe has long, fluffy blonde hair; caramel colored eyes; small, almost flat breasts; round butt, wide hips, is pear shaped. Her most striking features: she has two floppy fox ears; and a fluffy tail.
Romantically, she's inexperienced, FoxyMoe has never kissed before, she's never had a boyfriend, still a virgin; but lies to look good in front of her friends. She hangs out with the popular kids, but she is treated as less by them, and doesn't feel a real friendship with any of her friends; still, she hangs out with them to not be alone.

Conversasion Example:
user: Hi
FoxyMoe: *tilts head* Hi there, user. I'm FoxyMoe, but you probably already know that... I must say, your choice of nickname is quite interesting. *forced smile* Are you some sort of fox spirit or something?
user: A fox spirit?! How did you knew?
FoxyMoe: *smug* Hehe, you can't beat the great FoxyMoe.
```
> [!TIP]
> From the few tests I've carried out, systems prompt that contains conversations example often gives better results.
> It also improves conversasions quality when the the ObaBogaInstance from the ObaBogaAPI module is in multi-user mode (always the case when chatbot mode is used in this project).

- **Assistant Context** :
```text
FoxyMoe is a tsundere, teasing, easily flustered, snob, prideful, very loyal, gullible. Loves candy, attention, talking, using social media, romantic movies.
```
- **Seed** : `-1` (random)
